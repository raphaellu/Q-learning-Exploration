# Q-learning-Exploration
CSE 190 Final Project by Le Lu & Huajun ZhangIn this project, we are interested in implementing Q-learning as an extension to PA3. 
Similar to MDP, we want to find an optimal policy for each grid in a given map. 
However, this time probabilistic models are not known and have to be learned. 
This can be a common case where robot has no idea how accurate its movements are and Q-learning ensures the optimization of the final policy list even when robot takes undesired movements in some iterations.



To run the program:
`python learning.py`

by default, the algorithm will run with configuration.json. 
In order to
